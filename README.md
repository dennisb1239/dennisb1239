## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Dennis Breuer, and on this page I'd like to present a bit of my work on different topics related to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
Today I'm using my account for personal projects only, but I'm looking forward to expand this open-source oder professional activities as well. 

-  I’m currently working on finishing my master thesis on information extraction from patent applications with BERT
-  I’m currently learning C++ to be able to write code in another programming language 
-  I’m looking to collaborate on open source or professional projects related to AI in general, and specifically NLP
-  I’m looking for some mentoring to grow into an AI engineer role
- How to reach me: via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-breuer-838260134/)
